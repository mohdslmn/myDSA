Ques1. Implement Queue using stacks :
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Intuition:
=> insert operation will be same in both queue and stack.
=> remove operation will be different in queue.
=> we use 2nd stack as helper stack,
=> we remove items of 1st stack and move into 2nd helper stack
=> In such a way, when we perform pop() operation from 2nd stack we will get desired result.

Alexa has two stacks of non-negative integers, stack a  and stack b where index 0 denotes the top of the stack. Alexa challenges Nick to play the following game:

In each move, Nick can remove one integer from the top of either stack a or stack  b.
Nick keeps a running sum of the integers he removes from the two stacks.
Nick is disqualified from the game if, at any point, his running sum becomes greater than some integer  given at the beginning of the game.
Nick's final score is the total number of integers he has removed from the two stacks.
Given , , and  for  games, find the maximum possible score Nick can achieve.

Example


The maximum number of values Nick can remove is . There are two sets of choices with this result.

Remove  from  with a sum of .
Remove  from  and  from  with a sum of .
