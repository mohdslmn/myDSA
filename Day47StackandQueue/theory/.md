### STACK AND QUEUE###

Stack is a linear data structure which works on the principle of LIFO(Last in first out) or FILO(First in last out).
foe ex: Pile of plates

Important Terms:

*always insertion perform at start or top
*always data will be removed from top or start.
*push : insertion of data.
*pop : Deletion or removal of data.
*peek: will return top element of a stack.

Queue is also a linear data structure which works on the principal of FIFO(first in first out) or LILO(last in last out).
for ex: queue in the bank

* so insertion will be performed at last.
* and deletion will be performed from start.

Deque: In deque we can insert element from both the sides i.e from start and also from last.
