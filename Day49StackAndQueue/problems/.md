Ques1. Minimum Add to make paranthesis valid?

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string,
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".

Example 1:
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3

Ques2. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string,
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".
Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "())"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: s = "((("
Output: 3

Ques3. Design a Stack With Increment Operation

Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

Implement the CustomStack class:

CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.
int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.


Ques4. Task Scheduler:
Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
