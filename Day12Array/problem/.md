##Ques1.Unique Number of Occurrences
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

##Ques2 . . Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
