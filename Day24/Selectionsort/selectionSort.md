## Selection sort ##

=> Find max element from an array

=> Swap this max element with lastIndex element 

=> Reduce last Index by 1 bcoz lastindex of array is sorted

=> Repeat these processes for whole array 

=> If sorting array in descending order then find min element from an array and all these steps will be same

Time Complexity = O(n^2)
Space Complexity = O(1)
