##Ques1 : Filter Anagram

Anagrams are words that have the same number of same letters, but in different order.

For instance:

nap - pan
ear - are - era
cheaters - hectares - teachers
Write a function aclean(arr) that returns an array cleaned from anagrams.

For instance:

let arr = ["nap", "teachers", "cheaters", "PAN", "ear", "era", "hectares"];

alert( aclean(arr) ); // "nap,teachers,ear" or "PAN,cheaters,era"
From every anagram group should remain only one word, no matter which one.

##QUES2. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.


##Ques3. Find Players With Zero or One Losses
Medium

You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Example 1:

Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
Example 2:

Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
