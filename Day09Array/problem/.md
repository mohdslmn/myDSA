##Ques2. Nested Array Generator

Given a multi-dimensional array of integers, return a generator object which yields integers in the same order as inorder traversal.

A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains both integers and other multi-dimensional arrays.

inorder traversal iterates over each array from left to right, yielding any integers it encounters or applying inorder traversal to any arrays it encounters.

Input: arr = [[[6]],[1,3],[]]
Output: [6,1,3]
