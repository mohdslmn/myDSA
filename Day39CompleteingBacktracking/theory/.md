#### Including All Paths in Maze or Backtracking introduction####

  0   1   2 
 +-----------+ 
0|A |   |    |      
1|  |   |    |      
2|  |   |  D |      
 +-----------+

* this is a maze and A can travel in all directions Left,Right,Down,Up
if we make recursion call for Up and Left such as:
  if(r > 0){
    allPath(p + "U" , maze , r - 1, c) ;
  }
  if(c > 0){
    allPath(p + "L" , maze , r , c - 1);
  }

and we make all cell true then,
* it will generate output as stackoverflow but why?

to understand this draw recursion tree:

                        ( "p" , 0 , 0 )
                         /           \
                (  D , 1 ,0 )       ( R ,0 , 1  )
                /    |       \         
         (DD,2,0) ( DR,1,1 ) (DU,0,0)  

* here at (DU,0,0) is the problem of endless recursion call.

* it means , if A is at(D,1,0) , A can move in three ways 1st down  (DD,2,0) , 2nd right ( DR,1,1 ) , and A can move back towards Up at (0,0)
 it creates problem thats why recursion call won't end.

* Therefore, the solution is mark the path i.e. maintain a record of path from where it is moved make that cell false so
 dont allow it to visit the cell that are already visited.


* But still there is a problem:
  marking false == i have that cell in my current path.
  so when path is over , and you are in another recursion call , in this call it found that cell is already false due to previous recursion call, and to make another recursion call maze cell shoudnot be false.

* So the solution is when you move back from one recursion call , make maze cell as it was before recursion call.
How?
when you came out one recursive function call you are now in above recursion call , hence remark the cell as true.


THIS IS KNOWN AS BACKTRACKING.

SO BASICALLY, YOU ARE MAKING CHANGES WHILE YOUR GOING INTO BIGGER RECURSION CALL ,
BUT WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE OF RECURSIN CALL CHANGES YOU MADE VIA RECUSION CALL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILBLE FOR ANOTHER OR NEXT RECURSION CALL.
THAT IS BACKTRACKING.

WHY BACKTRACKING?
BECAUSE WHEN ARRAY IS PASSED IN ARGUMENT THEY FOLLOW THE SAME REFERENCE BUT MULTIPLE REFERENCE. SO WHEN YOU MAKECHANGE IN REFERENCE
IN ANY FUNCTION CALL IT WILL MODIFY ORIGINAL OBJECT OR ARRAY. THAT'S WHY WE ARE USING BACKTRACKING.
ALL FUNCTION CALLS ARE FOLLOWING SAME SINGLE OBJECT, THAT IS WHY WE ARE USING BACKTRACKING THERE IS ONLY ONE OBJECT.ORIGINAL OBJECT IS BEING MODIFIED THAT OBJECT IS BEING USED BY SO MANY FUCNTION CALLS HECNE WE HAVE TO KEEP IT(ARRAY OR OBJECT) NEW FOR EVERY FUNCTION CALL.
#### Another Question ####

Ques. you have to print the matrix and the path such as:

ex1:
 +-----------+ 
 |1 |   |    |      
 |2 |   |    |      
 |3 | 4 | 5  |      
 +-----------+
 output = DDRR

Ex2:
 +-----------+ 
 |1 |   |    |      
 |2 | 5 | 6  |      
 |3 | 4 | 7  |      
 +-----------+

output = DDRURD

sol: 
* take a step variable
* update the path array
* print it in base condition
* backtrack
