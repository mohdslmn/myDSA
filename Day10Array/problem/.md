TOPIC : ARRAY PARTIONING
##Ques1. Array Partition
Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.
Input: nums = [1,4,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:
1. (1, 4), (2, 3) -> min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3
2. (1, 3), (2, 4) -> min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3
3. (1, 2), (3, 4) -> min(1, 2) + min(3, 4) = 1 + 3 = 4
So the maximum possible sum is 4.

##Ques2.Find the Value of the Partition
You are given a positive integer array nums.

Partition nums into two arrays, nums1 and nums2, such that:

Each element of the array nums belongs to either the array nums1 or the array nums2.
Both arrays are non-empty.
The value of the partition is minimized.
The value of the partition is |max(nums1) - min(nums2)|.
Input: nums = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can partition the array nums into nums1 = [1,2] and nums2 = [3,4].
- The maximum element of the array nums1 is equal to 2.
- The minimum element of the array nums2 is equal to 3.
The value of the partition is |2 - 3| = 1. 
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum value out of all partitions.

##Ques3. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array
The pair sum of a pair (a,b) is equal to a + b. The maximum pair sum is the largest pair sum in a list of pairs.

For example, if we have pairs (1,5), (2,3), and (4,4), the maximum pair sum would be max(1+5, 2+3, 4+4) = max(6, 5, 8) = 8.
Given an array nums of even length n, pair up the elements of nums into n / 2 pairs such that:

Each element of nums is in exactly one pair, and
The maximum pair sum is minimized.
Return the minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements.

Input: nums = [3,5,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: The elements can be paired up into pairs (3,3) and (5,2).
The maximum pair sum is max(3+3, 5+2) = max(6, 7) = 7.

##QUES4.  Put Marbles in Bags
You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.

Divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:

No bag is empty.
If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].
The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. 
Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.
