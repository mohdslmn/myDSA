### Sliding Window Algorithm ###

* Origin of Sliding Window :-

lets understand with example:

Ques.find max sum of all subarrays of size 3 from given an array?
 arr = [2,3,5,2,9,7,1]

subarray's of size 3 will be:


1. [2,3,5]   = 10
2. [3,5,2]   = 10
3. [5,2,9]   = 16
4. [2,9,7]   = 18
5. [9,7,1]   = 17

max sum is 18 which is answer.

=>to solve this we used brute force approached first.
=> to optimize it , we search for repeatative task and i.e.
we are adding indeces as: 
0 + 1 + 2
1 + 2 + 3

here point is , we are adding 1 + 2 again what if we add as : 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 and then remove 0.
similarly: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 and remove 1, for each step we are sliding  one box forward.
this is known as Sliding Window Protocol.

here through sliding window algorithm we dont need to perform adding again and again
that results in optimization of time.

so we dont need 2nd for loop for adding.

Ques. How to Identify Sliding Window Problem?
Ans. terms to identify that we can use sliding window algorithm.
-Sliding Window Algorithm used for Arrays and Strings Data Structure.
-SubArray or SubString  is mentioned in asked questions.
-k is given or asked to find i.e. is nothing but window size

*Sliding window types:
there are two types:
1. fix sized window(that is discussed above).
2. variable sized window.

In varible size window , there is no fix size of window, 
in fix size window size is fixed like in above example 3 size is fixed but 
in variable size we can change window size like at first window size is 3 after that window size is 7
next window size is 1.
