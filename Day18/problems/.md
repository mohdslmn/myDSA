## Ques1  125. Valid Palindrome
Easy
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome


## Ques2. Count Vowels and Consonants:

Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

Input: str = "geeks for geeks"
Output:
Vowels: 5
Consonants: 8

Input: str = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output:
Vowels: 5
Consonants: 21

## Ques3.2062. Count Vowel Substrings of a String

A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.

Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aeiouu"
Output: 2
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "aeiouu"
- "aeiouu"

Example 2: Input: word = "cuaieuouac"
Output: 7
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"

## Ques4. 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
